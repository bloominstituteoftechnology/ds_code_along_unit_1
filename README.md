## Set Up

- To use these notebooks on Google Colab, you will need to download or clone the repository and upload the specific notebook to Colab.
- An easier approach is to use the [Open in Colab extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo?hl=en). (You will need to use the [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
